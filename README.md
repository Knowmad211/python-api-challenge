This repository has two deliverables located in the "WeatherPy" folder:
- "Abushacra_WeatherPy.ipynb" which is a Jupyter Notebook that extracts data from over 500 cities and creates scatterplots to showcase the following:
    - Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    - Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    - Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    - Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

- "Abushacra_VacationPy.ipynb" which is a Jupyter Notebook that does the following:
    - Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
    - Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition
    - For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates
    - Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.

# Starter Code and Source Data
- The starting code was provided to us in the following files located in the "Starter/starter_code" folder:
    - "VacationPy.ipynb"
    - "WeatherPy.ipynb"
- The data used in the first deliverable was taken from the OpenWeather API [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- The data used in the second deliverable was taken from the GeoApify API [GeoApify API](https://www.geoapify.com)
- We also used the CitiPy Python library [CitiPy Library](https://pypi.org/project/citipy/)
